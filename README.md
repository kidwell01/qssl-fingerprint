# QSSL Fingerprint (SimCLR, MoCo, Hybrid Quantum)

Goal: reproducible fingerprint self-supervised learning comparing:
- Classical SimCLR
- Hybrid SimCLR
- Classical MoCo
- Hybrid MoCo (missing piece / main deliverable)

Rules:
- data/, outputs/, logs/, checkpoints/ are never committed
- every experiment run must be reproducible from code + config
- every change must be committed with a clear message
